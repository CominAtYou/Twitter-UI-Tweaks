# Twitter Views Button Remover
Twitter's view button really shouldn't be where it is from a UX design perspective. That's what this extension will fix - it removes the views button from the Tweets on your timeline!

Tweet views are still listed on the Tweet details page.

## How to Install
Also available as a userscript for TamperMonkey - get it [here](https://gist.github.com/CominAtYou/7c7edca78183cc0eedf1d09a4c0f011f).

## Installation
1. Download or clone the source.
    - If you downloaded the source as a ZIP, be sure to extract it.
### Chrome (and Edge, Opera, etc.)
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`, and enable developer mode.
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder that you cloned/extracted.
### Firefox
2. Head to `about:debugging`, and click "This Firefox" in the sidebar.
3. Select "Load Temporary Add-on", and select the `manifest.json` file in the folder you cloned/extracted.


Done!
