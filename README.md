# Twitter-UI-Tweaks
A monorepo of browser extensions for reversing some of the UI changes made to Twitter and adding some UI improvements.

## Current Scripts

### Bird Icon Restorer
Restores Twitter's previous bird icon, before it was switched to an "X" sourced from a free webfont.

### Font Switcher
Changes the Twitter font to Segoe UI Variable Display. Useful for those who like the new Windows 11 font, or just dislike Twitter's "Chirp" font.

### Sidebar Blue Remover
Twitter's sidebar used to have a very useful lists button, but it was unfortunately replaced with a button for Twitter Blue. Replaces the Twitter Blue button with the old lists button.

### Tweet Text Enlarger
Enlarges the Tweet text on the Tweet details page back to its previous larger, more-readable text size.

### Views Button Remover
Removes the view button from Tweets in your timeline, stopping accidental clicks due to a very awkwardly-placed button and just making your timeline look better overall.
